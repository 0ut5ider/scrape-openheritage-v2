# Product Context: Open Heritage 3D Enhanced Data Scraper

## Problem Statement
The Open Heritage 3D website contains valuable information about heritage sites from around the world, but accessing this rich data programmatically is extremely challenging. The current interface requires manual browsing through individual project pages, making it difficult to:

1. **Comprehensive Data Access**: Get complete metadata including licensing, technical specifications, and contributor information
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Perform large-scale analysis across the entire heritage dataset
3. **Geographic Mapping**: Access coordinate data for spatial analysis and visualization
4. **Scholarly Integration**: Connect with external scholarly databases like DataCite
5. **Technical Specifications**: Access detailed information about data collection methods and equipment
6. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor changes in heritage digitization practices over time

## Enhanced Solution
This project creates a comprehensive data extraction system that:

### Core Functionality
- **Two-phase extraction**: Main listing + detailed individual project processing
- **Rich metadata capture**: 15+ categories of detailed information per project
- **Structured storage**: SQLite database with optimized schema for complex data
- **External integration**: DataCite API for scholarly metadata enrichment

### Data Categories Captured
1. **Basic Information**: Names, countries, DOIs, status
2. **Licensing**: Complete Creative Commons and other license details
3. **Technical Specifications**: Equipment, data types, file sizes, collection methods
4. **Geographic Data**: Coordinates, bounding boxes, spatial information
5. **Scholarly Metadata**: Publication dates, citations, academic references
6. **Contributors**: Complete contributor, collector, funder, and partner networks
7. **Interactive Content**: Point cloud viewers, external links, download files

## User Experience Goals
1. **Complete Data Access**: Single command provides comprehensive heritage database
2. **Research-Ready Format**: Structured data ready for analysis and visualization
3. **Geographic Integration**: Coordinate data enables mapping and spatial analysis
4. **Scholarly Standards**: DataCite integration provides academic-grade metadata
5. **Technical Transparency**: Equipment and methodology details support research reproducibility
6. **Network Analysis**: Contributor relationship data enables collaboration studies

## Expanded Target Users
1. **Heritage Researchers**: Comprehensive dataset for cultural and historical analysis
2. **Digital Preservation Organizations**: Complete technical specifications for preservation planning
3. **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Analysts**: Coordinate data for spatial heritage mapping
4. **Academic Institutions**: Scholarly metadata for research and citation purposes
5. **Technology Researchers**: Equipment and methodology data for digitization studies
6. **Cultural Policy Makers**: Global heritage digitization trends and patterns
7. **Software Developers**: Rich API-ready dataset for heritage applications
8. **Tourism and Education**: Geographic and descriptive data for public engagement

## Value Proposition
Transforms fragmented, manually-accessed heritage information into a comprehensive, research-ready database that enables systematic analysis of global cultural heritage digitization efforts, supporting academic research, policy development, and technological advancement in the cultural preservation field.
