# Active Context: Open Heritage 3D Enhanced Scraper

## Current Work Focus
Successfully completed comprehensive heritage data system with three major phases:
1. Basic scraper for main listing data
2. Enhanced detail extraction from individual project pages
3. **NEW**: Web-based database viewer for interactive data exploration

The system now provides both data extraction capabilities and a user-friendly web interface for viewing and analyzing the heritage database.

## Recent Major Accomplishments

### Enhanced Database Architecture
- **Two-table design**: `heritage_projects` (basic info) + `project_details` (comprehensive data)
- **JSON fields**: Complex data stored as JSON for contributors, data types, downloads
- **Geographic data**: Coordinates and bounding boxes extracted from page scripts
- **External integrations**: DataCite API metadata collection

### Comprehensive Data Extraction
Successfully extracting **15+ categories** of detailed information:
- General attributes (DOI, name, country, status)
- Background (site/project descriptions)
- Licensing (type, URL, terms)
- Dates (collection, publication)
- Technical (point cloud viewers, coordinates)
- Entities (contributors, collectors, funders, partners)
- Data specifications (types, equipment, file sizes)
- Downloads and external links
- DataCite scholarly metadata

### Performance Achievements
- **471 projects** processed (100% success rate)
- **470 detailed extractions** completed (99.8% success)
- **469 license extractions** (99.6% success)
- **313 point cloud viewers** identified
- **428 DataCite records** integrated (90.9% success)

### Web Viewer Implementation
Successfully built interactive database viewer:
- **Express.js server**: Serves both API and static files on localhost:3000
- **REST API endpoint**: GET /api/projects returns filtered columns as JSON
- **Responsive web interface**: Modern UI with sortable table headers
- **Client-side sorting**: Intelligent sorting by data type (dates, numbers, strings)
- **Real-time loading**: Fetch data from SQLite database on page load
- **Filtered data display**: Shows key columns (project name, country, status, project link, reuse score, publication date)

## Current System State
The scraper is production-ready and fully operational:
- Robust label normalization handles HTML variations
- Concurrent processing with rate limiting (3 concurrent requests)
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- JSON storage for complex data structures
- DataCite API integration for scholarly metadata

## Key Technical Patterns
- **Label normalization**: `normalizeLabel()` strips spaces/punctuation for consistent matching
- **Entity extraction**: Handles both linked and plain text contributor lists
- **Coordinate extraction**: Parses JavaScript map initialization for geographic data
- **Download detection**: Extracts file information from hidden form inputs
- **Concurrent processing**: Controlled concurrency to respect server resources

## Next Steps and Potential Enhancements
1. **Data Analysis Tools**: Create scripts to analyze the rich dataset
2. **Geographic Visualization**: Map heritage sites using extracted coordinates
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes in heritage digitization over time
4. **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports and data exports in various formats
5. **API Development**: Create REST API to serve the extracted data

## Important Decisions Made
- **Two-table approach**: Separates basic from detailed data for performance
- **JSON storage**: Flexible structure for complex contributor/data type information
- **Upsert pattern**: Efficiently handles updates without duplicates
- **Rate limiting**: Balances extraction speed with server courtesy
- **Error tolerance**: Continues processing when individual pages fail

## Project Insights and Learnings
- Heritage 3D sites span **global locations** with diverse cultural significance
- **Multiple data collection methods**: LiDAR, photogrammetry, terrestrial/aerial scanning
- **Varied licensing**: Creative Commons dominates, but with different restriction levels
- **Technical diversity**: Equipment ranges from consumer cameras to professional laser scanners
- **Scholarly integration**: Strong DOI/DataCite adoption for academic credibility

The system now provides researchers, cultural preservationists, and developers with comprehensive access to the Open Heritage 3D dataset through a robust, locally-stored database with rich metadata.
